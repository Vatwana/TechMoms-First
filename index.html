                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a loving mother of six, a 21 year military spouse, and lover of learning. After years of
                    being a military spouse, mother, volunteer, and working in service fields I was suprised and
                    delighted to learn, after a twenty year break,coding and technology still excite me.

        <h2>Traits and Skills</h2>
        <p><em>Adaptable: </em>Moving often from birth on has helped me to become adaptable to
            different enviroments and to get along and enjoy working with people who have
            different personalities and backrounds.</p>
        <p><em>Love of Learning: </em>From the time I was a young child I have loved learning
            and challenging myself. From elementary school when I first saw and used a
            Commodore 64 to now I have had a special interest in coding and circuitry. </p>
        <p><em>Creative Problem Solving: </em>From the time I was a young child I would find
            creative ways to accomplish tasks that interested or were assigned to me. From
            braiding baling twine into ropes to using a breadboard and components to build
            and adapt various circuits for practical jokes to learning new methods of teaching
            math to students who hate it I find ways to remove obstacles and solve problems</p>
